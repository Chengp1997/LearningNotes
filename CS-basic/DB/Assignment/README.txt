we write a simple java program to manipulate the library.
When you enter the program.
First, you should enter your membershipID(showed in the table member).
Then, you will get the full menu of our manipulation of the library.
you can charge your balance,rent DVD from the library, and also return your book to library.
DVDs have copys, you can rent from one library and return it to another library.
And the next are our queries of the library database.
